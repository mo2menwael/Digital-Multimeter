# Digital Multimeter
Using an AVR microcontroller interfacing with an LCD to display measurement values and a keypad to select the active mode: Ammeter, Voltmeter, or Ohmmeter. The circuit processes input through a differential Op-Amp and then a range selector, also utilizing an Op-Amp. Finally, the processed signal is sent to the AVR's ADC pins, which allows the measurement to be displayed on the LCD.
